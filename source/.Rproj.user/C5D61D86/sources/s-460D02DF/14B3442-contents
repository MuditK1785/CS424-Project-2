# Project: #2 Every Breath You Take
# About  : A web-based application that visualizes data in multiple ways using R, Shiny, ggplot2, & Shiny Dashboard.
#
# This is a Shiny web application. You can run the application by clicking the 'Run App' button above.
# Find out more about building applications with Shiny here: http://shiny.rstudio.com/

library(shinydashboard)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(feather)


# Gather names of all the files in the directory that contain "daily".
dailyFiles = list.files(pattern = "^daily.*")

# Combine all the files into one data frame.
dailyData = do.call(rbind, lapply(dailyFiles, function(x) read_csv(x, col_names = TRUE)))

# Gather names of all the files in the directory that contain "daily".
hourlyFiles = list.files(pattern = "^hourly.*")

# Combine all the files into one data frame.
hourlyData = do.call(rbind, lapply(hourlyFiles, function(x) read_csv(x, col_names = TRUE)))






# Define UI for application that draws a histogram
ui <- fluidPage(
   
   # Application title
   titlePanel("proj2"),
   
   # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
   sidebarLayout(
      sidebarPanel(
         sliderInput("bins",
                     "Number of bins:",
                     min = 1,
                     max = 50,
                     value = 30)
      ),
      
      # Show a plot of the generated distribution
      mainPanel(
         plotOutput("distPlot")
      )
   )
)

# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
server <- function(input, output) {
   
   output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
   })
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
