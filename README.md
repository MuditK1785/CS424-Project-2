# CS424-Project-2

**MOST RECENTLY EDITED FILES CAN BE FOUND HERE**
**HOURLY DATA FILE IS TOO BIG**

**TODO**
Make sure UI **scales** on the class room screen

Make sure UI is **reachable** on class room screen

Theme the UI since, since default colors are boring ðŸ˜ª

**For a C you need to **

~~allow the user to do all the 'B' range things for the 10 counties plus two of your choice from P1 for 1990 through 2018 (or 2019 if the data appears). While there is daily data from 1980, it gets better by 1990.
download and read in all of the daily_aqi_by_county files from 1990 to present~~

~~allow the user to choose a year and any of the 12 counties and
see the daily AQI data for that year as line chart and see what pollutant was contributing the most to the AQI for each of those days
see a stacked bar chart and table for each month of that year showing the number of days where the AQI was good / moderate / unhealthy for sensitive / unhealthy / very unhealthy / hazardous / unknown~~

~~allow the user to choose a year and AQI or one of the pollutants (ozone, SO2, CO, NO2, PM2.5, PM10) and see a map showing the locations of the top 100 counties that have an issue with AQI or that pollutant based on the annual data, in terms of the largest percentage of bad days for that pollutant (e.g. the user could pick 1992 and CO, or 1995 and AQI). This map should use color to show the relative 'badness' of those 100 counties.~~

for final project turn in - bring up information on the dashboard about who wrote the project, what libraries are being used to visualize it, where the data came from, etc

**For a B you need to add:**

~~download the hourly Ozone, SO2, CO, NO2, PM2.5 FRM/FEM, PM10 mass files, as well as the hourly_WIND files, and the hourly_TEMP files for 2018~~

allow the user to choose one of the 12 counties and then allow the user to choose a date in some intuitive way that shows which days have data and then allow the user to pick any subset or all of hourly Ozone, SO2, CO, NO2, PM2.5, PM10, wind, and temperature and show them as different lines on the same line chart

~~enhance the interface for the pollutant map to allow the user to pick the number of counties to view (i.e. give the user a slider to control how many counties are shown). Note that the number of counties with data ranges from around 680 to 800 depending on the year.~~

allow the user to display values in either imperial or metric units.

**For an A you need to add:**

allow the user to choose any county, similar to the A range in Project 1, and any date in 2018 and see the data visualizations from the 'C' and  'B' range.

enhance the interface for the pollutant map to allow the user to show a heatmap for any of the pollutants for a given day chosen by the user in 2018.
